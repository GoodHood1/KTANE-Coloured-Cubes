RGB GENERAL IDEAS:
SET USING TERNARY RGB AND CUBE SIZES
POSITION OF CUBES SHIFT AND/OR SWAP SET VALUES
PERMUTATIONS BETWEEN STAGES COMBINES THESE MODIFICATIONS
CAN PRESS STAGE LIGHTS TO GO BACK BETWEEN STAGES
MAYBE USE POSITIONS OF PREVIOUS STAGE SOLUTIONS AS PART OF SOLVE METHOD??R
STAGE 3 POSSIBLY SET-IFY PREVIOUS TWO POSITIONS TO GET THE THIRD POSITION.
MAYBE USE STAGE-LIGHTS AS PART OF SOLVING PROCESS.

VISUALS:
MODULE STARTS OFF IN ALL BLACK/A SOLID COLOUR, MAYBE RANDOM? PINK LOOKS NICE.
ONCE SOLVED, THE CUBES CAN JUST VIBE.*
PERMUTATIONS MAYBE BE CONVEYED BY USE SMALLER SUB-CYCLES, FOR EACH CYCLE ALL STATIONARY CUBES HIDE INSIDE THE MODULE WHILE THE MOVING ONES CYCLE, THEN THE STATIONARY CUBES COME BACK (OR THE NEXT CYCLING ONES IF THERE ARE MORE CYCLES).
SELECTED CUBES CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR (EG YELLOW) AND THEN GO GREEN IF CORRECT AND RED IF WRONG (ALL CUBES CAN BRIEFLY FLASH RED WHEN WRONG).
PRESSING THE SCREEN SHOULD TOGGLE TO SIZE VIEWING MODE: ALL CUBES GO GRAY (OR SOME NICE COLOUR) AND HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT SHOWING ALL THREE SIZES.
SCREEN SHOWS THE NAME OF THE COLOUR OF THE HIGHLIGHTED CUBE (IN SIZE MODE STATE THE SIZE OF THE HIGHLIGHTED CUBE INSTEAD).
*FUN SOLVE ANIMATION WITH WAVE ANIMATION USING SIZES :D

EACH CUBE HAS:
POSITION
COLOUR
SIZE
VALUE

STAGE 1 SIZE BASED ON PORT COUNT
STAGE 2 SIZE BASED ON INDICATOR COUNT

NEED TO SET DISPLAY TO "SOLVED" (OR SIMILAR) ON SOLVE.
